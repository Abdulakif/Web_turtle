              <p class="des">In recent years, it is evident that the mankind slaughter turtles and their eggs for consumption. Further, the disposed turtle shells are used for trading in markets in order to make invaluable products, including medicines.

            <p class="des">Moreover, harmful oils and petroleum that are disposed into the rivers and ocean harm sea turtles to the extreme. The fishing industry is a grave menace to these innocent animals. When sea turtles encounter with discarded fishing nets, they consume them mistaken for seaweed; hence, detrimenting them.

          <img src="Images/climate_threat.jpg" alt="climate_threat">
            <p class="des">The nature also contributes in the demise of sea turtles. Due to an increase in the temperature, the sea turtles have difficulties in laying their eggs, especially in beaches. This gradually results in in lower output of its species which eventually leads to the extinction of sea turtles.</p>

          We are committed to reducing and eliminating the hazards to sea turtles. We work to build a future in which sea turtles flourish in their native environments via proactive conservation initiatives and community participation. These are some of the main preventative techniques we use:
          <!-- nested list for prevention -->
          <ol>
            <li>  <!--list 1-->
              Habitat Conservation:

                <li>In order to create and preserve protected nesting habitats, we collaborate closely with regional communities, governmental organizations, and volunteers. These locations are watched over to minimize disruption and provide a secure environment for sea turtles who are laying their eggs.</li>
                <li>Restoration of coastal habitat: In order to provide a better environment for nesting and hatching, we actively participate in habitat restoration activities, such as dune stabilization, beach nourishment, and vegetation planting.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>  <!--list 2-->

              <ul>
                <li>Beach cleanups: To reduce the risk of entanglement and ingestion for sea turtles, we regularly arrange beach cleaning programs to remove waste and pollutants from nesting locations.</li>
                <li>Campaigns for plastic reduction: Through educational efforts and neighborhood projects, we increase public awareness of the negative impacts of plastic pollution and motivate people and companies to use less plastic.</li>
              </ul>
